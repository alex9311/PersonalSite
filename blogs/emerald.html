<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
This was a quick hike but is worth sharing because we did it in the snow!
The hike was around 6 miles with only about 600ft of climbing.
Note that we used two cars and shuttled for this hike, the out and back would be twice as long.

<p>
Starting from D.L. Bliss State park, we walked along an asphalt road for a little ways until it turned into a single track.
Others had already hiked the trail since the last snowfall, so we had footprints to follow there.
The forest service was doing controlled burns in the Northern section of the trail, which was impressive to see.
The first 3 miles or so were mostly downhill with a few short uphills.
We lost the trail around Emerald Point for a while and wandered along the shore of emerald bay.
It is hard to feel completely lost in this area since all you do is follow the shoreline, but the brush did get pretty dense off-trail.

Eventually we made our way back to the trail again and hiked into the Vikingsholm area.
Apparently there is a short of castle here, but we never saw it.
The hike back up to the road was the toughest part of the hike, especially due to the icy conditions.
You can see on the map above that it's pretty steep.

This was a fun short hike with great views of Emerald Bay.
The snowy conditions were novel and were definitely managable.
Jacuzzi session in the cold outdoors after the hike felt great!
