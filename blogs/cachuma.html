<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
My buddy and I wanted to do a challenging hike in the Santa Barbara backcountry (Los Padres National Forest) and came across this trail. 
We started at Cachuma Saddle, climbed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hundredpeaks.org/guides/06h.htm">San Rafael Mountain</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hundredpeaks.org/guides/06f.htm">McKinley Mountain</a>, and came back to Cachuma Saddle.
The hike was long for a day hike (23 miles) and a good amount of climbing (5000ft).
We enjoyed the spectacular views of the coast and backcountry, as the trail takes you on both sides of the ridge.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>
We found easy parking in a small dirt lot right in front of a white gate marking the trail head. 
The first 3 miles are pretty consistent uphill with an average 7% grade.
At around 4.5 miles in after some rollers, we hit an area known as <b>Hells Half Acre</b>.
This area is mostly flat with characteristic long grass all around the trail head. 
I imagine this would be extra beautiful in Spring when the flowers are blooming. 
</p>
<p>
After about a mile in Hells Half Acre, the climbing started to get more serious again.
There's a about 1.5 miles of 12% grade, which was tiring.
Past that steep section, its a less intense climb for about another mile and a half to <b>McKinley Springs Camp</b> (<i>total 8.4 miles from gate</i>).
McKinley Springs Camp had a toilet, picnic tables, and water reservoir. 
We didn't try the water, as it was frozen and we didn't have any way to treat it.
Finally, with another pretty easy mile and a half past the camp, we reached <b>McKinley Saddle</b> (<i>total 9 miles from gate</i>).

<p>
From the saddle, you can choose to do a quick scramble up <b>McKinley Mountain</b> or head out towards <b>San Rafael Mountain</b>. 
You can see this on the map above, the saddle is where the trail forks.
Up to this point, the trail was wide and cleared.
San Rafael Mountain is another 1.8 miles further and 800ft up on single-track trail.
Some of the trail was pretty washed away from the recent rainfall.
The peak is not super obvious but there was a short stake in the ground at the top.

<p>
McKinley Mountain is 0.6 miles and 431ft more vertical from the saddle. 
This was more overgrown than the San Rafael trail and starts off very steep.
I recommend taking the short time to get this summit, especially if you have long pants on to protect from the brush.
</p>
<p>
After climbing McKinley, we headed back to the saddle the way be came and back down past McKinley Camp.
We planned to summit <b>Cachuma Mountain</b> on the way back but my feet were totally destroyed from my boots so we decided to skip it.
The trail to Cachuma Mountain was about 5.5 or 6 miles from McKinley Saddle going back to the trail head (<i>~3 miles from trailhead if you hit it on the way up</i>).
</p>
<p>
The whole hike with both peaks took about 8 hours, including a lunch break and some exploring around the top of McKinley Mountain.
Although we didn't see any, this trail seemed to be popular with mountain bikers. 
The whole 9 miles to McKinley saddle is nice wide trail perfect for biking.
I found another great blog detailing this hike <a target="_blank" href="http://davidstillman.blogspot.com/2013/06/san-rafael-mountain-mckinley-mountain.html">here</a>.

<h3>Driving Directions</h3>
<p>
It takes about an hour to drive to the trail head from the bottom of the 154 in Santa Barbara.
Just get directions from Google Maps to the intersection of <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/3KnQe31JDrB2">Figueroa Mountain Rd & Sunset Valley Rd</a>, should do the trick.
