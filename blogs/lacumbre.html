This is a ~30 mile loop with about 4,500 feet of climbing.
The first 9 miles of the climb make a <i>Hors Catégorie</i> climb, which is the toughest type of bike climb according to the French!
I'll talk more about that below.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
The accepted starting point for this climb is the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1113+N+San+Marcos+Rd,+Goleta,+CA+93111/@34.4595025,-119.7976655,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80e94018b99aaf3d:0x671380be91b7ad3a!8m2!3d34.4596013!4d-119.7955163">bridge on North San Marcos Road</a> at the end of the neighborhoods. 
From here, you have a 3 mile climb with 1,100 feet elevation to the 154 highweay up <i>Old San Marcos Pass</i>.
Doing just this first part of the climb as a speed run is also a popular ride. 
The gnarliest part is the switchbacks, where you get a third of a mile with 12% grade average.
</p>
<p>
From the 154, you start up the section called <i>Painted Cave</i>, which is 3.5 miles long and offers 1,300 feet of elevation gain.
The first mile of painted cave is tough with an average 10% grade. 
You go past a state park with historic caves with Chumash paintings on the walls.
Evenutally, you reach the East Camino Cielo.
</p>
<p>
The final 7 miles to the summit stay on the <i>East Camino Cielo</i> and is about 1100 feet of elevation gain.
After 2.7 miles along the Camino Cielo, you reach the <i>Repeater Towers</i> which is a small summit and also can be a good turnaround point.
After the towers, you pass what's known as the <i>Glass Factory</i> along the way, which is where our nation's better half can be seen shooting guns.
A little ways further, you're at the summit!
</p>
<p>
So, that's the climb: three sections totaling about 13.5 miles and 3,700 feet of elevation gain.
The way down is straightforward.
It is about 8 miles from the top until you reach civilization again.
At about 2 miles down the road forks and it is possible to continue left along the Camino Cielo, but the way down is to the right on Gibraltar road.
This will pop you out on the intersection of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/360+El+Cielito+Rd,+Santa+Barbara,+CA+93105/@34.4517993,-119.6914276,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x80e9135e105b99dd:0xb9415b9d488f52a8!2sEl+Cielito+Rd,+Santa+Barbara,+CA+93105!3b1!8m2!3d34.4496965!4d-119.6897966!3m4!1s0x80e9135e9f04a9bf:0x4e64dab8beddf73!8m2!3d34.4518002!4d-119.689204">El Cielito Road and Gibraltar road</a>.
From there, you can get back on the 192 and take it to where the loop started!
<h3>Climbing Categorizations</h3>
<p>
My favorite part of climbing categorization is the cycling lore behind how the categories first started.
The story is that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_2CV">Citroën 2CV</a> was originally used to categorize the climbs.
If the car could make it up the hill in 4th gear, it was a Category 4 climb; if it could get up in 3rd gear, it was a Category 3 climb; and so on up to 1st gear.
If the 2CV could not get up the climb, it was <i>Hors Catégory</i> (HC) which means "outside of categories".
So, if the legend is to be believed, an old Citroën would not have made it up to La Cumbre Peak on our route.
