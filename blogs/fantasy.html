I have worked a lot with ExtJS 4 and 5 over the years and want to try out what I've learned to build a larger creative app.
What I'm doing here is building a data aggregator for Fantasy Football Drafting. 
So far, I have data from <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/">Fantasy Pros</a> and from <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/teams/injuries/nfl/all/">RotoWorld</a>.
This is a work in progress and I'll be updating this page as I add more data and application features.
</p>
<p>
Its a good thing I have lots of time until the next Fantasy season starts!
Some features I'm planning on adding include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scrape data from <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/fantasy-football-ranks--preseason--16-164442676.html">Yahoo</a>, the 2017 rankings aren't out yet</li>
  <li>Double-click for player details functionality</li>
  <li>Full-grid searching across columns</li>
</ul>
<p>
I put the application in an iframe below, but the full-page version can be seen <a href="blogs/resources/fantasy/build/production/Fantasy/" target="_blank">here</a>.
